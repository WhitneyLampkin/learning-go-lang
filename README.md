## Lessons learned from 'Take your first steps with Go'

1. Be mindful of where packages/modules are created in the directory
1. Be sure to open the scr folder from the correct $GOPATH path (This can break imports.)
1. Use 'go build' to automatically add all dependencies to go.mod
    - go get -u github.com/whitneylampkin/learning-go-lang/[FOLDER]@master
